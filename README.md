- 👋 Hi, I’m @shahzaib adnan khan
- 👀 As a Computer Engineering (CE) student and enthusiast, I have a deep interest in both hardware projects and web development. Over the course of my journey, I have designed and developed various websites and have also worked on hardware projects, combining both aspects of engineering to create innovative solutions. This unique combination of skills has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of engineering. I'm passionate about creating websites that are functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing, and I enjoy exploring new technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible.
Feel free to check out my projects, and let me know if you have any questions or feedback!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects
